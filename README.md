# VancouverCrime
This is the instruction for the codes of UCL MSc CEGE0042 coursework. The aim of this coursework is to conduct an exploratory spatio-temporal analysis of Vancouver crime data and make predictions.

Most of the code is derived from Dr James’ book Spatio-temporal Analytics in R.
Data source: Crime in Vancouver, Vancouver district.

Directories in the coursework will point to a folder called ‘Coursework’. Please create this folder somewhere in your computer and use ‘setwd’ to set the working directory to point to it. For example, if ‘Coursework’ is placed in ‘/Users’ then run setwd(‘/Users/Coursework’).
